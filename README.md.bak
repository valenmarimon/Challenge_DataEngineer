# Challenge_Jobsity
Description of the proyect:
The scripts that are mentioned below are meant to fullfil the requirements stated in the Challenge sent.
* Create_Database.py: This is the first script that must be ran. It creates the connection to your local server(SQL server) and creates a Test database if non existant.

* Create_Table_Trips.py: Next script to be executed. If it doesn't exist already, creates the Trips table with the columns provided in the Trips.csv file.

* Extract_to_Database.py: This script reads the Trips.csv file located in the same folder and extracts the rows from the file. After that, it inserts these records into the Trips table in the Test database.
						If successful, it requests an email address where the user is going to be sent an email informing the ran finished properly on the current date.
						This email will be sent from a test email address(testvm.challenge@gmail.com).
						
* Report_Weekly_Averages.py: Final script. It shows an input requiring the user to select between getting a report based on a rectangular Bounding Box (specifying 4 different points) or by Region.
							If the first option is selected, it will show a table with the weekly average of trips that were origined inside the bounding box.
							Else, it shows the weekly average of trips for the selected region.
							When selecting the report of a Bounding Box, the following points, extracted from the file, can be used as reference to create it:
								- POINT (10.00384920850646 53.65220121071665)
								- POINT (7.513135087952872 45.04417775442011)
